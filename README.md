# brainstorm_CPL
A collection of brainstorm scripts and processes used in the Cognitive Psychophysiology Lab (CPL) at the College of William &amp; Mary

## Using this toolbox:
Simply copy the .m files into your local brainstorm directory.  Typically, these directories are located at:\\
WINDOWS             -  C:\Windows\Username\.brainstorm\process\\
LINUX/APPLE OSx     -  $HOME/.brainstorm/process \\
   *NOTE that you may need to hold Command + Shift + . (period) in order to reveal hidden folders/files in OSx
